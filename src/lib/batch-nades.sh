# Drain NADE_BATCH_JOBS against one running cs2 connected to one nade practice
# server, then keep asking the api for more until it says stop: the rest of
# the map's queue, and the other maps' once the server has changed level.
# Sourced by run-nades.sh. Per-job failures never halt the batch —

# NADE_BATCH_JOBS is a JSON array; each entry is
#   { "job_id": "<uuid>", "token": "<session token>", "spec": { ... } }
# and spec carries the utility_lineups row the pod needs (column names verbatim):
#   lineup_id, lineup_name, map_name, nade_type ("Smoke"|"Flash"|
#   "HighExplosive"|"Molotov"|"Decoy"), side, origin_x/y/z, eye_z, view_yaw,
#   view_pitch, flight_time_ms, confidence, plugin_runtime, technique,
#   throw_strength, jump_throw_bind, and either has_seed:true|false or the six
#   initial_pos_*/initial_vel_* values, approach (the run-up's 64Hz samples,
#   null for a throw made standing still), plus
#   output: { resolution: "720p"|"1080p", fps: <int> }.
#
# The practice plugin stages a lineup by lineup_id (`/render_stage <id>`).
